I smoked weed 1-3 times per day for over 4 years with very few and short tolerance breaks. \n\nThere\u2019s so many reasons that once per week is the best way to use weed. For one, each time you use it you\u2019ll have a much lower tolerance than if you used everyday, resulting in a MUCH more powerful and awesome experience. \n\nTwo, it keeps you from becoming dopamine dependent on it, a problem that I\u2019ve had for a long time. When you stop using everyday, you recover your brain\u2019s ability to find happiness in more modest rewards. It\u2019s easier to enjoy the little things in life when you\u2019re not constantly looking towards weed for happiness. Overall, you will be a happier individual.\n\nThree, it\u2019s better for your brain. Hardcore stoners will convince themselves that weed is not bad for your brain at all and you can smoke three times a day and it\u2019s no big deal. But they\u2019re kidding themselves. I know, because I was one of them. \n\nFour, it\u2019s easier on your wallet. For the average person, smoking weed everyday can be very expensive. I\u2019ve spent up to $400 a month on weed in the past, which for me is SO much money. That\u2019s over a third of my mortgage payment. That could be money for new shoes, clothes, vacations, experiences, retirement, but instead I was spending that money to get high everyday. When you smoke once per week, it\u2019s so much more affordable that you can buy the best and highest quality weed possible and still save loads of money. For me personally, switching from everyday to once a week cut my monthly spending from about $400/month down to about $20. \n\nFive, you take much greater advantage of the introspective and therapeutic properties of the weed experience when you allow your tolerance to recover.

Im a 24M! \n\nOver the course of my life, ive attempted to date numerous girls that all bascially ended in a giant L. Each time, I would employ the same strategy: take a good portion of time to befriend her before eventually confessing my feelings.\n\nRecently, I've come to realise that just making female friends and keeping it that way is kind of cool!!! IMO, trying to push things further is super high-risk. From my exiperence, she will likely just reject me anyways and now things are super awkward. Im currently friends with a girl ive asked out in the past, but it doesnt really feel the same, every time I hang out with her, in the back of my head I keep thinking about the time I asked her out and it gives me a weird, uncomfortable feeling! \n\nIn conclusion, just making female friends without an objective is awesome!
